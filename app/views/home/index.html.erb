    first-served basis. If you don't wish to sign up in advance, please arrive early.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-4 md:text-lg italic">
    However, please note that in order to sign up for a session, you will first need to join our

  </p>
  <p class="md:text-lg">
    However, we're happy to explore additional systems in the future, so keep an eye on this page or visit our

    We're embracing the whole "table-driven narrative" aspect of Daggerheart. As such, all of our GMs will be running sessions based on improvisation and prompts at the table. As
    a player, don't be surprised if your GM asks *you* to name that random merchant you just met, or describe what you might have found in the chest you opened!

            , click "Create Character" (at the bottom) and fill out a character form. This can be anything you like.
            <br/>It will also ask for a character URL; most use the link to their character on

        Preferably, a full set of polyhedral dice and a second set of d12 dice which are distinct from each other.
        <br/>You'll use those 2d12 as your "duality" dice. One will be

        You'll also want to bring a character with you, either a paper character sheet and domain cards, or a digital copy.

    What are the West Marches? We're glad you asked! Essentially, a "West Marches" campaign is a community-driven, collaborative storytelling mechanic for RPG games with multiple
    GMs and tables. Each session is a one-shot that adds to the collective fiction, lore, and legends of our shared world, "The Gi'Gabi Coast." Players may freely choose which
    sessions they will participate in, without losing out on any of the "story".
