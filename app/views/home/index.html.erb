    However, we <em>encourage everyone</em> to sign up for a
    <a href="https://www.westmarches.games/communities/lore-league/sessions" target="_blank" class="text-yellow-400 hover:text-yellow-300">session</a>
    in advance to secure a spot at one of our tables. Signups have reserved seating until 6:15; after that,
    any remaining seats will be available on a first-come, first-served basis.
    If you don't wish to sign up in advance, please arrive early.

    Our current focus is on
    <a href="https://daggerheart.com" target="_blank" class="text-yellow-400 hover:text-yellow-300">Daggerheart</a>
    and all tables will be running this ruleset this season.

  <p class="text-lg">
    However, we're happy to explore additional systems in the future, so keep an eye on this page or visit our

    We're embracing the whole "table-driven narrative" aspect of Daggerheart. As such, all of our GMs will be running sessions
    based on improvisation and prompts at the table. As a player, don't be surprised if your GM asks *you* to name that random
    merchant you just met, or describe what you might have found in the chest you opened!

    What are the West Marches? We're glad you asked!
    Essentially, a "West Marches" campaign is a community-driven, collaborative storytelling mechanic for RPG games with multiple
    GMs and tables. Each session is a one-shot that adds to the collective fiction, lore, and legends of our shared world,
    "The Gi'Gabi Coast." Players may freely choose which sessions they will participate in, without losing out on any of the "story".
